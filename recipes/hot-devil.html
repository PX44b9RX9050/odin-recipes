    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 kg floury potatoes</li>
      <li>4 apples, f.e. Jonagold</li>
      <li>30 gram butter</li>
      <li>30 ml cream</li>
      <li>50 ml milk</li>
      <li>small handful of breadcrumbs</li>
      <li>pepper and salt to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

      <h4>Preparation (15 minutes)</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel the potatoes and slice them into chunks.</li>
            <li>Rinse the potato chunks with cold water.</li>
            <li>Add the potato chunks to a medium-sized pan.</li>
            <li>Fill the pan with water and add salt.</li>
            <li>Bring the pan to a boil.</li>
            <li>Once the water is boiling, turn down the heat.</li>
            <li>Let the potatoes cook for about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Depending on the size of the potato chunks, peel 3 apples and cut them into chunks as well.</li>
            <li>Add the apple chunks into the pan with the potatoes.</li>
            <li>Allow the potatoes and apples to cook together.</li>
            <li>Check the potatoes with a fork to see if they are ready.</li>
        </ol>

      <h4>Recipe (10 minutes)</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Drain the potatoes and apples and press them through a fine sieve using the ladle. The easiest way is to get a spoonful of drained potatoes at a time. This way your mashed potatoes will be very smooth without any lumps.</li>
            <li>Peel the last apple and cut as fine as you can, stir into the mash, this way the hete bliksem will have a little bite to it. Classic hete bliksem is smooth, but the crunchy part will make a difference, really!</li>
            <li>Add butter, cream, and milk to the potato and apple mixture. Add the breadcrumbs and season with pepper and salt.</li>
            <li>You can now decide how creamy you like the hete bliksem to be by adding more milk and/or cream. We decided to keep it quite firm.</li>
        </ol>
